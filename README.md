# Simple balenaBlock Eyes

Yes, there are more sophisticated ways to put spooky eyes on a TFT display attached to a Raspberry Pi, but perhaps none simpler than this.

This lightweight project uses [balenaBlocks]() to deploy two of the three containers needed to display spooky eyes on almost any small screen. The [browser]() and [fbcp]() blocks are primitives you can use for any project you want to display something via Chromium on the device (or via an attached HDMI monitor).
